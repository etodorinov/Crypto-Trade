There are three initial coins, created by each of the users. These coins are Eagle coin created by userOne (abv@abv.bg), Happy Cat coin created by userTwo (gbg@gbg.bg) and Pepper coin created by userThree (abv@gbg.bg). These coins can not be removed even by their creators, although the delete button is visible and functional, so there are always coins to demostrate the basic functionalities - catalogue, details, edit, buy and search. If an attempt to be removed is done an appropriate message is displayed. If one wants to test the delete functionality one should create his own coin by registering a user or by using any of the default users - userOne (abv@abv.bg), userTwo (gbg@gbg.bg) or userThree (abv@gbg.bg).
